How to be a Friend to Someone with Autism
This website is dedicated to promoting inclusion and understanding for school-aged children with autism. It provides valuable insights and practical tips 
for parents, adults, and anyone interested in learning how to interact compassionately with children on the autism spectrum.

By spreading this knowledge to parents, teachers, or anyone interested, in hopes that eventually it will be taught to school-aged children, we can foster a more tolerant and caring environment. 
Understanding and acceptance can significantly enhance the quality of life for kids with autism and their families, leading to stronger friendships, improved social skills, and a more inclusive community. 
The benefits extend beyond the individuals with autism, enriching the lives of all students by teaching empathy and diversity.
