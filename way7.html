                <h1>Remember Sensory Sensitivity</h1>
                <p><b>Children with autism often have sensory sensitivities. Being mindful of their sensory needs can help create a more comfortable environment for them.</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ask your friend or someone that knows them if there are any specific sensory issues they experience, such as sensitivity to loud noises, bright lights, or certain textures.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Avoid situations that may overwhelm them and be understanding if they need to take a break.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Provide sensory-friendly options when planning activities, such as quieter settings or calming tools.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Respect their sensory boundaries and never force them into uncomfortable situations.</b></li>
                </ul>
