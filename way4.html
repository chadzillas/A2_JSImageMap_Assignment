                <h1>Communicate Clearly</h1>
                <p><b>Effective communication is essential when interacting with children with autism. Use clear, concise language and be patient while listening to their responses. You should assume that kids with autism can understand what you are saying in general, but many times do not yet know how to respond with the right words. So they will replace words with phrases from shows or movies that likely will respond, and give an answer just not the answer you was looking for. Or kids might respond with hand gestures or try and point you to the response if relavent. Just know they are trying. With your help they will succeed.</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Speak in a calm and clear manner. Avoid using slang or complex phrases that might be confusing.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Use visual aids or gestures to help convey your message if needed.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Give your friend time to process what you have said and respond at their own pace.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Be attentive and show that you are listening by maintaining eye contact and nodding.</b></li>
                </ul>
