                <p><b>It's natural to feel unsure or anxious about interacting with someone who has autism, but don't let fear hold you back. Approach the friendship with an open heart and mind.</b></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Educate yourself about autism to better understand your friend's behaviors and needs.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Ask questions and seek guidance from those who have more experience if you're unsure about something.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Be patient with yourself as you learn and grow in the friendship.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Remember that your friend values your effort and kindness, even if they may not always express it.</b></li>
